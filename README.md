# SpatialSoccerAnalysis
 This is a series of projects slowly building of StatsBomb's datasets. I am attempting to apply spatial analytic techniques and libraries to the problem of analyzing soccer information. This is entirely python based.
 
 These examples are provided as is with miminal support, although feedback and comments are welcome. These are basic examples and don't break down the match events in every possible way. They are meant to be a stepping stone to deeper analysis.
 

## Libraries
 Required external libraries:
 
 Pandas
 GeoPandas
 Shapely
 Matplotlib
 
 Optional libraries:
 
 Seaborn
 
## Dataset

The dataset used in these examples are pulled from StatsBomb's open datasets. As you can see I had trouble understanding the location information contained in their json event datasets. I found them counterintutive to how I typically view locations. I think I understand now, and appreciate their (assumed) reasoning behind it, but you'll see I play around with placement on the pitch.
