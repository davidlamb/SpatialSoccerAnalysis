# Spatial Soccer Analysis
 Repository of code I use to analyze many aspects of soccer\football. My background is in Geography so I apply spatial analytic techniques to the sport. I include the ssalib2 python library for easily parsing data from open sources.
 
## Projects
 [There are a variety of projects available for review.](projects)
 
 [Including for fantasy sports](fantasy)
 
## Visualizations

- [Interactive visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ssalib2#!/). Mostly Fantasy Premier League data...

## Location

As a Geographer, I was very interested in how Location is used in event and tracking data.  [location](_LocationInDepth.md)

## Dataset

The dataset used in these examples are pulled from StatsBomb's open datasets. As you can see I had trouble understanding the location information contained in their json event datasets. I found them counterintutive to how I typically view locations. I think I understand now, and appreciate their (assumed) reasoning behind it, but you'll see I play around with placement on the pitch.

## Other libraries (very limited list)
Some other libraries that I've found:
Soccermatics by JoGall is an R library. It also includes the tromso dataset. [https://github.com/JoGall/soccermatics](https://github.com/JoGall/soccermatics)
Barron83's fork of soccermatics seems to have more functions.[https://github.com/barron83/soccermatics](https://github.com/barron83/soccermatics)
